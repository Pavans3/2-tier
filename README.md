# Two-Tier Application Deployment with Docker

## Overview

This repository contains the code and configurations for deploying a two-tier application using Docker. The application consists of a frontend server powered by Nginx and a backend database managed by MongoDB. Docker is utilized to containerize both components, ensuring easy deployment and scalability.

## Features

- **Nginx Frontend**: Nginx is used to serve web content and manage HTTP requests efficiently.
- **MongoDB Backend**: MongoDB serves as the backend database, providing reliable data storage and retrieval capabilities.
- **Custom Docker Network**: A custom Docker network is established to facilitate seamless communication between the frontend and backend containers.
- **Optimized Deployment**: The deployment process is streamlined, ensuring smooth operations of the application components.
- **Scalability**: The Dockerized architecture enables easy scaling of the application to handle increased loads.
